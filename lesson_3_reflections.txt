When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- I need to use remote repository to have access to it from other computers or if i want someone to contribute in my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- what if i have made changes on my local repository then i will have merge conflict.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- forks is cloning on the remote and original copy have tracks for these forks. clone is a copy from the remote repository onto local. while branches is a copy that made in the same repository to make changes on it before merging on the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- we can track any changes on the remote if happend, so we can merging any conflicts easily.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- It will be hard to collaborate without using Git or Github, It will be hard to keep tracking of the changes made on the files and hard to fix conflicts and merging files.
 
 When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 - I would use separate branch when i have collaborators working on same repository. working on master directly is less complicated than working on different branchs, but then you can not handle the conflicts.
