When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- I need to use remote repository to have access to it from other computers or if i want someone to contribute in my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- what if i have made changes on my local repository then i will have merge conflict.
