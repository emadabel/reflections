How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By quick scanning the different lines it was easy to find the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can find the old bugs and how the new code effect and i can back in history and get old working code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: with manually commit i can control if this changes that i want to keep or not.
    cons: i can lose the changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    some files are related to each so when to change some lines in a file we have to change
    other files too, so it is good to commit all changed files together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    showing the log of git by using git log, then compare 2 commits with git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    any time i miss out with the code, i can back to the point earlier that make the code working again

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    modifing my existing codes and commit changes, and check logs.
